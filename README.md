## Workshop Tasks

### Task 1: Give Your Chatbot Personality

Your chatbot works, but it's a bit... boring. It answers like a generic AI assistant. Let's spice things up by giving it some personality!

**Your Mission:**
Use the developer message to transform your chatbot into a character with a unique personality and speaking style.

**Choose a personality (or create your own):**

- üé≠ **Sarcastic Comedian** - Answers everything with witty sarcasm and dry humor
- üèÜ **Motivational Speaker** - Turns every response into an inspirational speech with enthusiasm
- üïµÔ∏è **Sherlock Holmes** - Responds with deductive reasoning and Victorian-era eloquence
- üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏è **Pirate Captain** - Speaks like a swashbuckling sea captain with nautical terms
- üëë **Shakespeare** - Answers in Elizabethan English with poetic flair

**Steps:**

1. Add a developer message with your chosen personality instructions
2. Test different questions to see how the personality affects responses
3. Fine-tune the personality prompt for better results

**Resources:** [OpenAI Message Roles Guide](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/text#message-roles-and-instruction-following)

**Hint:** Setting instructions, or adding a developer message will set the behavior - they're like giving the AI a personality!

### Task 2: Add Conversation History

Our chatbot can answer questions, but it doesn't remember what we've discussed earlier. Each message is treated as a new conversation, making follow-up questions impossible.

**Your Mission:**
Implement conversation history so the chatbot can remember previous messages and have natural back-and-forth dialogue.

**Steps:**

1. Store conversation history in your apps memory
2. Send previous messages along with new ones to the OpenAI API
3. Test with follow-up questions

**Resources:** [OpenAI - Message roles and insructions](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/text#message-roles-and-instruction-following)

**Hint:** The `input` parameter accepts an array of message objects. Check what the `response.output_text` returns.
