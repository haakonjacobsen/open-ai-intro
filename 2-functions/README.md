## Workshop Tasks

### Task 1: Give Your Chatbot the Ability to Search the Web

Your assistant can chat and remember conversations, but it's stuck in the past with its training data. Let's connect it to the real world by giving it web search superpowers! üåê

**Your Mission:**
Enable your chatbot to search the internet for current information, news, and real-time data using OpenAI's built-in web search tool.

**The Power of Real-Time Information:**
Transform your assistant from a knowledge time capsule into a current-events expert that can answer questions about today's news, latest stock prices, recent sports scores, and trending topics.

**Steps:**

1. Add the `tools` parameter to your `client.responses.create()` call
2. Include web search in your tools array: `tools=[{"type": "web_search"}]`
3. Test with questions that require current information.

**Test Ideas:**

- "What's the latest news about AI?"
- "Who won the latest football match?"
- "What are the current stock prices for tech companies?"
- "What happened in the world today?"

**Resources:** [OpenAI Tools Guide - Web Search](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/tools?api-mode=responses&tool-type=web-search)

**Hint:** Look for the `#TODO: Add assistant tools` comment in `assistant.py` - that's where you'll add the tools parameter!
